        \u2022 A triangle with two congruent sides and congruent base angles.</string>

    <!--Properties-->
    <string name="isosceles_triangle_property_1">
        \u2022 Has two congruent sides.
        \n\u2022 Has congruent base angles.
        \n\u2022 The unequal side of an isosceles triangle
        is usually referred to as the Base of the triangle.
        \n\u2022 When the 3rd angle is a right angle, it is called a "Right Isosceles Triangle"
        \n\u2022 The altitude is a perpendicular distance from the base to the topmost vertex.
        \n\u2022 Has an altitude which:
        \n\t\t\u2022 Meets the base at a right angle,
        \n\t\t\u2022 Bisects the apex angle, and
        \n\t\t\u2022 Splits the original isosceles triangle into two congruent halves
        \n\u2022 If two triangles are congruent, then the angles opposite to them are also congruent.
