          \u2022Hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle.
        This will always be the longest side of a right angle.

         \u2022 The two sides that are not the hypotenuse.
        They are the two sides making up the right angle itself.

    <!--Properties-->
    <string name="right_triangle_property_1">
         \u2022 A right triangle can also be Isosceles if the two sides that include
        the right angle are equal in length.

         \n\u2022 A right triangle can never be equilateral, since the hypotenuse
        is always longer than either of the other two sides.
        \n \u2022 The hypotenuse is always across from the right angle.

        \n \u2022 The hypotenuse will be twice the length of the shorter side
        if the acute angle is measuring 30 and 60 degrees.

        \n \u2022 In geometry according to Side- Angle-Side rule: If two sides and
        the included angle of a triangle are congruent to two sides and the
        included angle of another triangle.
        Then the two triangles are said to be congruent.

       \u2022  Acute angles of a right triangle are complementary.
        \n  \u2022  A + C + 90 = 180
         \n  \u2022  ⇒⇒ A + C = 90
         \n  \u2022  ⇒⇒ A = 90 - C.
