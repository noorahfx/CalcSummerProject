    <!-- Equilateral TRIANGLE -->
    <!-- Definition -->
    <string name="equilateral_triangle_def">
       \u2022 A triangle in which all the three sides are of equal length.
        Equilateral triangles are equiangular, that is the interior angles are
        congruent to each other and each angle will be equal to 60째
        and doesn\'t matter how big or small the triangle is.</string>

    <!--Properties-->
    <string name="equilateral_triangle_property_1">
        \u2022 All three angles of an equilateral triangle are always 60째
        \n \u2022 Interior angles of a triangle add up to 180째
        and exterior angles of a triangle add up to 360째.

       \n \u2022 Equilateral triangles are bilaterally symmetrical in three different ways.

       \n \u2022 Equilateral triangle have three lines of symmetry from each vertex
        to the midpoint of the opposite side.Lines are known to be as medians,
        perpendicular bisectors, altitudes and angle bisectors of the triangle.

      \n \u2022 The point where in the three lines intersect is the centroid,
        in center, circumcenter and the orthocenter of the triangle.

        \n \u2022 All equilateral triangles are also Isosceles triangles and
        if you stack six equilateral triangles together you will get a hexagon.
